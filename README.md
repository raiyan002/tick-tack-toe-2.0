# Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0 - Strategic Moving Pieces Game

An innovative twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Angular 18 and Material Design. This version introduces a unique "moving pieces" mechanic that adds strategic depth to the traditional game.

## 🎮 Game Features

### Unique Gameplay Mechanics
- **Moving Pieces**: Players can only have 3 pieces on the board at any time
- **Strategic Depth**: When placing your 4th piece, your oldest piece automatically disappears
- **Classic Win Conditions**: Get 3 pieces in a row, column, or diagonal to win
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show which pieces will be removed next

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful Material Design interface with smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Interactive Rules**: Built-in tutorial explaining the unique game mechanics
- **Smart Notifications**: Contextual feedback instead of intrusive alert boxes
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular 18 with Standalone Components
- **UI Library**: Angular Material Design
- **Styling**: CSS3 with animations and responsive design
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed development
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI

## 📱 Responsive Design

The game is fully responsive and tested on:
- 🖥️ **Desktop** (1200px+): Full-featured experience
- 📱 **Tablet** (768px-1199px): Touch-optimized layout  
- 📱 **Mobile** (480px-767px): Compact mobile interface
- 📱 **Small Mobile** (<480px): Minimal essential layout

## 🎯 How to Play

3. **Strategic Planning**: Remember you can only have 3 pieces on the board
4. **Win Condition**: Get 3 pieces in a row, column, or diagonal
